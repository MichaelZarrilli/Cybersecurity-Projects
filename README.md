This portfolio is meant to showcase projects that I completed from the Google cybersecurity certificate, as well as other programming projects.

I am currently studying to achieve the ISC2 CC certification. Afterwards, I plan on pursuing further certifications in this order: CompTIA Security+ --> eJPT --> eCTHP
